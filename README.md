## Architecture

TaskManager follows a fully serverless architecture using AWS services:

1. **Task Management API**  
   - Built using **.NET 8 Web API**.  
   - Hosted as an **AWS Lambda function**.  
   - Uses **Amazon API Gateway** (if applicable) to expose endpoints.  
   - Stores task data in **Amazon DynamoDB**.  

2. **Monthly Report Generation**  
   - Triggered by **AWS EventBridge** on the 1st day of each month.  
   - Executed by a dedicated **AWS Lambda function**.  
   - Reads completed task data from **Amazon DynamoDB**.  
   - Generates a PDF report with task completion metrics.  
   - Stores the report in an **Amazon S3 bucket**.
